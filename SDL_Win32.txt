Using SDL on Windows Systems
============================
By default OpenDUNE on Windows uses WinAPI, so it doesn't require any
 other library to run on Windows.
However, it is possible using SDL libraries to improve the experience
 of gameplaying, being able to toggle fullscreen or zooming in/out the
 window size.


Compiling SDL 1.2
-----------------
After setting up SDL 1.2 libraries, to successfully compile on MSVC,
 going to Project Properties (All Configurations):
- on C/C++=>Preprocessor, set WITH_SDL into Preprocessor Definitions
- on Linker=>System, set /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS or /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE
   (to define entry point on main for SDL)
- on Linker=>Command Line, set /FORCE:MULTIPLE on Additional Options
   (to avoid 'multiple definitions' problems)


Compiling SDL 2.0
-----------------
After setting up SDL 2.0 libraries, to successfully compile on MSVC,
 going to Project Properties (All Configurations):
- on C/C++=>Preprocessor, set WITH_SDL2 into Preprocessor Definitions
- on Linker=>System, set /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS or /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE
  (to define entry point on main for SDL)


Additional Features
-------------------
While playing OpenDUNE, you can press F11 (or Alt+Enter) to toggle
 fullscreen, or press +/- keys to zoom in/out window size, maintaining
 original ratio resolution.

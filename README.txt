About
-----
OpenDUNE is an open source re-creation of the popular game "Dune II",
 originally made by Westwood Studios, and released by Virgin Entertainment.
It attempts to re-create the original game and apply modern technology to it
 to allow it to be run natively on most operating systems.

OpenDUNE is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0. For
 more information, see the COPYING file included with every release and source
 download of the game.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
OpenDUNE is written in ANSI C (C89), and only requires SDL to run. In result,
 OpenDUNE should run on all platforms supported by SDL.
Currently we official support the following platforms:

  - Linux
  - Mac OS X (Intel, i686 / x86_64, 10.4+)
  - Windows


Requirements
------------
OpenDUNE doesn't require any library to run on Windows. For Mac OS X we make
 so-called static-compiled binaries, which means all libraries it depends on
 (mostly LibSDL) are already included in the binary, and no action is
 required on your part
For Linux, you need to install LibSDL yourself. It is available in every
 package manager, and the chances are high it is already installed on your
 system.
In order to use sounds and music on Linux, you need a working ALSA driver.


Installation & Running
----------------------
Extract OpenDUNE.
Copy the original Dune2 1.07 data files (including dune2.exe) to data/. All
 filenames should be lowercase for case-sensitive file systems (Linux, MacOSX).
 All three existing versions of the Dune 1.07 data files (eu, hs and us) will
  work, but only with the eu/hs data files the French language will work, and
  only with the eu data files the German language will work.
Start 'opendune'.

Enhancement over Dune2
======================
When OpenDUNE is started in enhanced mode (default), a lot of bugs and
 problems which are in the original Dune2 version, are fixed.

Below is the complete listing of all those bugs and problems, per category.
 Every entry describes the problem, where the solution is in all cases
 obvious by the way the problem is described and therefore the solution is
 not mentioned as such.


Structure
---------
- When building a Wall, the owner-bits are not cleared correctly, which in
    theory could mean a Wall build by you could show up as owned by Sadukar.
- When building a structure completely on slabs, it still degrades. This seems
    in contrast with the idea of slabs.
- When building a structure, only the fog is removed (with a radius of 2) from
    the first tile defined in the layout of the structure. This is mostly
    noticable with Palace and Oil Refinery, leaving parts of them in the fog.
- Windtraps that have less than 50% hp still produce 50% of the power, even so
    the GUI tells you differently. Of course the GUI makes more sense in this
    case.
- Repair cost calculation is unfair. Dune2 uses a 256 float-resolution,
    meaning that you get rounding errors very fast. In result, Palace costs
    nothing to repair, and a windtrap costs 2 credits instead of 3 credits per
    repair tick. In detail: ((2 * 256 / hitpoints) * credits + 128) / 256. The
    first part causes rounding errors.
- If one structure gives a script error, all structures after it in the linked
    list are not handled. This doesn't really seem correct.
- In Script function which finds the closest unit to target, it doesn't pick
    the closest unit within range, but the one with the highest index within
    range.
- Too many tile colours are remapped with house colours, causing graphical
    issues with the IX building. It maps 0x90 .. 0xA0 instead of 0x90 .. 0x96.
- When taking over a building (by having an infantry walk in it while the
    structure is on low hitpoints), your own units keep firing at it, and will
    most likely destroy it.
- When you attack the structure of the AI, the idea is that they massively
    start to attack you (payback and stuff). To do this, Dune2 searches all
    Units with type 0 (Carry-alls), instead of type 0xFFFF (all units).
    WARNING: this glitch makes the game much easier in its original form.
- A structure in production also counts towards your storable spice,
    producing power, and/or requiring power. It does not check if the structure
    is in fact placed on the map.


Unit
----
- Once a Unit enters a tile on which it starts to wobble, it will never stop
    wobbling, even if it enters a tile where it shouldn't wobble.
- The warning of an enemy approach tends to be wrong. This due to a math
    failure in the code.
- Units could only have a maximum fire delay of 255 ticks, causing inconsistent
    firing rates between unit types on slower game speeds. e.g. a launcher will
    fire as frequently as a tank on the slowest game speed.
- At normal game speed, the fire delay for deviators would overflow.  This
    caused deviators to fire almost as often as a trike.


Scenario
--------
- A mistake in reading the '+' causes repeat for reinforcements to be always
    false. In result reinforcement is only send once.
- The structure '% hitpoints' is ignored. In result all structures always
    have 100% hitpoints.


House
-----
- When you have a refinery and lost all your harvesters, you get a new one even
    if you are currently building one in heavy vehicle factory.
- Silo credit capping is done outside the main house loop, causing it to only
    update the house which owns the latest structure. This allows you to go
    over your silo capacity most of the time, and then losing it all of a
    sudden (when you start building a structure).


Teams
-----
- If a team gives a script error, all other teams are aborted.


SaveLoad
--------
- The save routine allowed a NAME chunk up to 65536 bytes, where 255 bytes
    should be sufficient for any sane name (both excluding the \0).


General
-------
- The screen telling if you have the security question wrong/right is there
    for such short time, you never really see it.
- When loading a game, the fadein is barely visible because it is against the
    screen how it will turn out, minus the selection of an active building.


Map
---
- When a unit moves over the top of a mound, you never get abandoned vehicles
    nor hiding enemy units
- When getting free Trikes on the map, you never got ownership of them. The
    parameter order is switched, where the type of the unit becomes the number
    of the house, and the house becomes the value of Trike (13). This also
    means that these vehicles read/write outside the house struct, which in
    terms results in random artifects.
